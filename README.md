# My personal website and blog created with Jekyll

This is a project to build a landing page and full site for my personal domain, [gavingreer.com](https://www.gavingreer.com). Other goals for site content include a blog (with comments), professional CV/Resume page, projects list, and links to social media. 

During development of this project, my personal goals and self-imposed limitations include:
- Jekyll 
  - Learn more about how it works generally
  - How to use themes and customize them
  - Exposure to Ruby and Gems
- Development Environment
  - Limit all development work to the WSL2 Ubuntu instance on my laptop
  - Limit all file editing to VIM 
  - All Git commits and repo management from the command line
- Production Environment
  - Publish project to a Linode VPS instance
  - Secure with SSL 
  - Serve with Nginx
- SASS 
  - Learn SASS basics
  - Use sass to configure and consolidate site CSS
- Deployment
  - Target inital deployment date of 2020-02-03
  - Initial deployment will be a static transfer of site files through the commandline as a clone from Github.
  - Long term goal is to utilize a CI/CD strategy using Jenkins/Github hooks/etc.
