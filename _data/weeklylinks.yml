    outlet: The Verge
    tldr: "Microsoft announced two dual screen devices late in 2019: the laptop sized Surface Neo and the dual screen smartphone Surface Duo. There's lots to get excited about with these devices. Although dual screen laptop prototypes and even production models have existed in the past, it was without native Windows OS support. This article, walks through the new Windows 10X designed for dual, hinged devices. Overall, it looks great. I'm excited to see what else they do with it."

    tldr: Somewhat predictably, Marques' response is both yes and no. I think that yeah, we might be at peak smartphone in the current "glass sandwich" form factor. Where I differ might be in the things he mentions as "outer edge". Are folding phones better? Time will tell. His comparison to "peak car" is interesting too.

    outlet: It's FOSS
    tldr: "I had never really considered that there were different terminals that could be installed. Plus, I've never had a reason to look for alternatives based on lack of functionality in the default choice. It makes sense though. The terminal is just another piece of software. I think I still prefer the simplicity and transparency of default installations. "

    tldr: "I have a Synology DS216j at home and I've been really happy with it. This is a very quick look at and updated model. What sets Synology devices apart from other options is the simplicity of setup while still offering a lot of functionality when you're ready for it. If you are looking for a good NAS device, this is a great option."

    - title: "Astros' Cheating Haunts Clayton Kershaw's Memory of 2017 World Series"
      url: https://www.si.com/mlb/2020/02/20/astros-cheating-scandal-clayton-kershaw
      outlet: "Sports Illustrated"
      tldr: "I'm a big Clayton Kershaw fan and this just makes me sad. Kershaw has a reputation for being completely dominant in the regular season, but choking in the post-season. 2017 looked to be the year he turned that around. That is, until he played a game against the Astros at Minute Maid park in Game 5 of the World Series. Kershaw gave up two leads and the Dodgers lost the game and eventually the Series. The recent news that the Astros cheated in 2017 puts all of this in a new and very ugly light. To his credit, Kershow is doing his part to move past it."

      outlet: Scott Hanselman
      tldr: "This article looks at a few examples of the new tools available in WSL2. The tight integration with VS Code is very cool. You can run multiple Linux distros side by side and even migrate Linux installations between Windows systems with just a few Powershell commands. He mentions <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701\">Windows Terminal</a> and I'd also recommend checking it out. You can tell Scott gets a kick out of this stuff. He seems to have fun with it."

      tldr: "I originally saw this on Twitter. It's a handy reference for quickly navigating through text in the CLI. I didn't know most of these keyboard shortcuts. Neat."
