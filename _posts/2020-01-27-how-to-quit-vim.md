title: How to quit VIM

Welcome to the wonderful world of VIM. :)

I can completely understand the frustration you might be feeling upon finding this site. Its easy though:

1. **Press `<ESC>`**
  - This is to make sure you are in command mode 
2. **Type `:q` and press `<ENTER>`** 
  - In VIM, you begin commands with the colon followed by any number of characters that represent commands. In this case, you want `q` for quit. 
3. **Learn how to use VIM because its totally worth it.**

## Learn VIM

I was skeptical at first. I used `nano` for most quick edits in the shell and VSCode for all my other development work. But after working through [VIM with Vigor](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_adv_vimvigor.php) from the writers of *The Linux Command Line* book, I was hooked. 

Give it a shot. There's a lot to learn and its actually a lot of fun.
